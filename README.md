# STAGN: Spatio-Temporal Attention Graph Network for Traffic Prediction 

This repository contains implementation of STAGN model for traffic prediction, which is based on the the Graph Multi Attention Network (GMAN) model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08415). 
The model consists of 52 dimensional spatial embeddings generated by Node2Vec and 12 dimensional temporal embeddings generated by CNN. The temporal attention layer 
uses a balanced spectral clustering, which is a combination of spectral clustering and K-means clustering.

## Temporal Attention in the ST-Att Block

In the original GMAN model, given a node $v_i$ at time step $t$, its attention score to all of the other time steps of the same node uses a multi-head approach as shown.

Next, using these attentions, the temporal embedding is calculated by

In STAGN, given a node $v_i$ at time step $t$, the goal is to calculate its attention score to all of the other time steps of each node belonging to the same cluster as $v_i$. Now, suppose $v_k$ is some node in the cluster with $v_i$ which is called $C_{v_i}$, then the attentions are calculated using the same multihead approach as shown:

After calculating the attentions, the temporal embedding will be

For the implementation of this to STAGN, first the groupings generated from the balanced spectral clustering is used. Then balanced spectral clustering is done on 325 nodes to generate 65 groups of 5 nodes each. The data is then rearranged so that all the nodes belonging to the same cluster are grouped together. After this, a matrix is created which contains all the values of $(h_{v_i, t_j}^{(l-1)})$ passed through $f_{t,1}^{(k)}$ and another matrix which represents the embeddings passed through $f_{t,2}^{(k)}$ and $f_{t,3}^{(k)}$. Then matrix multiplications is usedto do the computations of the temporal embeddings.
